  title: "A Probabilistic Perspective on Tiling Sparse Tensor Algebra"
  abstract: "<p>
    Sparse tensor algebra computations are often memory-bound due to irregular access
    patterns and low arithmetic intensity. We present <b>D2T2</b> (Data-Driven Tensor
    Tiling), a framework that optimizes static coordinate-space tiling schemes to
    minimize memory traffic by identifying and leveraging relevant high-level statistics
    from input operands. For a given tensor algebra computation, D2T2 collects statistics
    from input tensors, builds a probability distribution-based model of the tensor
    computation, and uses it to predict memory traffic for various tiling configurations.
    It then searches over tile shape and size configurations to minimize total traffic.
    We evaluate D2T2 against Tailors and DRT, two state-of-the-art tiling schemes for
    sparse tensor algebra. D2T2 achieves, on average, a <b>2.54×</b> speedup over Tailors
    and a <b>1.13×</b> lower memory bandwidth compared to DRT for sparse–sparse matrix
    multiplication (SpMSpM). It further achieves <b>1.22–48.94×</b> lower bandwidth for
    SpMSpM and up to <b>34.31×</b> lower bandwidth for tensor operations (TTM and MTTKRP)
    than conservative static tiling schemes. Unlike prior tiling techniques, D2T2 is
    deployable without specialized hardware support. On Opal, a 16 nm sparse tensor
    algebra accelerator, D2T2-generated tiling configurations achieve <b>1.23–3.34×</b>
    speedups compared to their original hand-tuned configurations.

  title: "Compilation of Qubit Circuits to Optimized Qutrit Circuits"
  abstract: "<p>
    Quantum computers are a revolutionary class of computational platforms that
    are capable of solving computationally hard problems. However, today’s quantum
    hardware is subject to noise and decoherence issues that together limit the
    scale and complexity of the quantum circuits that can be implemented. Recently,
    practitioners have developed qutrit-based quantum hardware platforms that compute
    over |0⟩, |1⟩, and |2⟩ states, and have presented circuit depth reduction
    techniques using qutrits’ higher energy |2⟩ states to temporarily store
    information. However, thus far, such quantum circuits that use higher order
    states for temporary storage need to be manually crafted by hardware designers.
    We present Dare, an optimizing compiler for qutrit circuits that implement qubit
    computations. Dare deploys a qutrit circuit decomposition algorithm and a rewrite
    engine to construct and optimize qutrit circuits. We evaluate Dare against
    hand-optimized qutrit circuits and qubit circuits, and find Dare delivers up to
    65% depth improvement over manual qutrit implementations, and 43–75% depth
    improvement over qubit circuits. We also perform a fidelity analysis and find
    DARE-optimized qutrit circuits deliver up to 8.9× higher fidelity circuits than
    their manually implemented counterparts.

  venue: "IEEE Symposium on VLSI Technology & Circuits (VLSI)"
  abstract: "<p>
    Onyx is the first fully programmable accelerator for
    arbitrary sparse tensor algebra kernels. Unlike prior work, it
    supports higher-order tensors, multiple inputs, and fusion. It
    achieves this with a coarse-grained reconfigurable array
    (CGRA) that has composable memory primitives for storing
    compressed any-order tensors and compute primitives that
    eliminate ineffectual computations in sparse expressions.
    Further, Onyx improves dense image processing and machine
    learning (ML) with application-specialized compute tiles,
    memory tiles optimized for affine access patterns, and hybrid
    clock gating in the global buffer. We achieve up to 565x better
    energy-delay product (EDP) for sparse kernels vs. CPUs with
    sparse libraries, and up to 76% and 85% lower EDP for image
    processing and ML, respectively, vs. Amber [1].

  title: "APEX: A Framework for Automated Processing Element Design Space Exploration using Frequent Subgraph Analysis"
  abstract: "<p>
    The architecture of a coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) processing
    element (PE) has a significant effect on the performance and energy-efficiency
    of an application running on the CGRA. This paper presents APEX, an automated
    approach for generating specialized PE architectures for an application or an
    application domain. APEX first analyzes application domain benchmarks using
    frequent subgraph mining to extract commonly occurring computational subgraphs.
    APEX then generates specialized PEs by merging subgraphs using a datapath graph
    merging algorithm. The merged datapath graphs are translated into a PE
    specification from which we automatically generate the PE hardware description
    in Verilog along with a compiler that maps applications to the PE. The PE
    hardware and compiler are inserted into a flexible CGRA generation and
    compilation toolchain that allows for agile evaluation of CGRAs. We evaluate
    APEX for two domains, machine learning and image processing. For image
    processing applications, our automatically generated CGRAs with specialized PEs
    achieve from 5% to 30% less area and from 22% to 46% less energy compared to a
    general-purpose CGRA. For machine learning applications, our automatically
    generated CGRAs consume 16% to 59% less energy and 22% to 39% less area than a
    general-purpose CGRA. This work paves the way for creation of application
    domain-driven design-space exploration frameworks that automatically generate
    efficient programmable accelerators, with a much lower design effort for both

  title: "CODEBench: A Neural Architecture and Hardware Accelerator Co-Design Framework"
  abstract: "<p>
    Recently, automated co-design of machine learning (ML) models and accelerator
    architectures has attracted significant attention from both the industry and
    academia. However, most co-design frameworks either explore a limited search
    space or employ suboptimal exploration techniques for simultaneous design
    decision investigations of the ML model and the accelerator. Furthermore,
    training the ML model and simulating the accelerator performance is
    computationally expensive. To address these limitations, this work proposes a
    novel neural architecture and hardware accelerator co-design framework, called
    CODEBench. It comprises two new benchmarking sub-frameworks, CNNBench and
    AccelBench, which explore expanded design spaces of convolutional neural
    networks (CNNs) and CNN accelerators. CNNBench leverages an advanced search
    technique, Bayesian Optimization using Second-order Gradients and Heteroscedastic
    Surrogate Model for Neural Architecture Search, to efficiently train a neural
    heteroscedastic surrogate model to converge to an optimal CNN architecture by
    employing second-order gradients. AccelBench performs cycle-accurate simulations
    for diverse accelerator architectures in a vast design space. With the proposed
    co-design method, our best CNN–accelerator pair achieves 1.4% higher accuracy on
    the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the state-of-the-art pair while enabling 59.1%
    lower latency and 60.8% lower energy consumption. On the ImageNet dataset, it
    achieves 3.7% higher Top-1 accuracy at 43.8% lower latency and 11.2% lower

    Auto-NBA, by achieving 1.5% higher accuracy and 34.7× higher throughput while
    enabling 11.0× lower energy-delay product and 4.0× lower chip area on CIFAR-10.

  title: "A 4.2-pJ/Conv 10-b Asynchronous ADC with Hybrid Two-Tier Level-Crossing Event Coding"
  abstract: "<p>
    This paper presents a 10-bit asynchronous analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
    that achieves 4.2 pJ per conversion through a hybrid two-tier level-crossing
    event coding scheme. The proposed design leverages CMOS technology and novel
    event-driven encoding techniques to enable high-throughput continuous tracking
    with improved energy efficiency. Target applications include energy-constrained
    systems such as biomedical signal acquisition (e.g., electrocardiography) and
    other low-power computing platforms.
